# Introduction

Smart Meters is a new product introduced by Government of
India, and the technology is acquired from the technology
partners. Smart meters being consumer products and are
highly sensitive in the market need to be manufactured and
calibrated to the required accuracy and tested for all the
critical electrical parameters during the production stage
itself. So, the testing of the smart energy meter is a must to
check whether the meter is fit for connecting in the houses.
There are various parameters for testing the energy meter
before it is ready for packaging.
