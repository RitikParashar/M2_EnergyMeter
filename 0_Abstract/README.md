## ENERGY METER

The requirement for unit reading from energy
meter to record the unit from the houses is still done by human
assistants. The power accuracy is unknown for consumers and
has to wait for bill to make payments. Due to manual reading
human errors will occur and hence the value may not be
accurate. An energy meter is developed which act as an
interface between service provider and consumer. Large
numbers of consumers who do not pay the bill at time make
service provider loss ridden. Therefore, nonpaying bill by the
consumers as a remote meter on/off based systems are
implemented recently. Thus, reducing human labors and errors
in meter reading and nuisance of non-payers of bill. The
requirement of testing energy meter is very essential for
calculating the efficiency of the system. In existing models multi
meters are used for measuring the parameters by individually
of the energy meter, which may cause delay for the assembling
the board. In order to overcome this problem energy meter
tester which can analyses more than one at the time is
proposed.

Smart Meters is a new product introduced by Government of
India, and the technology is acquired from the technology
partners. Smart meters being consumer products and are
highly sensitive in the market need to be manufactured and
calibrated to the required accuracy and tested for all the
critical electrical parameters during the production stage
itself. So, the testing of the smart energy meter is a must to
check whether the meter is fit for connecting in the houses.
There are various parameters for testing the energy meter
before it is ready for packaging.
